# Relations

A relation is a table and vice versa. Two dimensional with rows and columns.
- Attributes become columns
- Individual entities become rows

Primary keys usually listed first.
- Cardinality is considered to the number of rows in the relation
- Arity is the number of columns in the table/attributes in the relation

## Mapping an ER model

### Mapping 1:1 relationships
Three possibilities
1. Mandatory at both ends
2. Mandatory at one end, optional at the other
3. Optional at both ends

#### Mandatory at both ends
Often possible to subsume one entity type into the other. It's a straight
mapping, with a unique connection. May or may not be appropriate to combine,
depending on the kind of real world relationships being modeled.
- Choice of which subsumes which depends on which is the more
  important/frequently accessed entity.
- Attributes in common are removed
- Key of the subsumed entity becomes a normal attribute
- Primary key is usually the same as the original primary from the important entity

If not combined:
- Primary key of only one of the entities becomes a foreign key in the other.
  Having two foreign keys is duplication.

#### Mandatory <-> OPtional
Optional entities may be subsumed into the mandatory entity as per prior
example. However, it is better not to do this, because it creates a number of
null entries.

Reasons not to combine are the same with the additional reason:
- Very few of the mandatory entities are involved. Causes wasted space with
  many blank or null entries.

#### Optional at both ends
Cannot be combined because:
1. If the relationship is optional in both directions, then both entities are
   strong.
2. If both entities are strong, they must be able to be indexed in a void, without relying on something that may or may not exist.
3. If a primary entity is chosen and the secondary entity doesn't relate to a primary entity, then it won't have a primary key and can't be indexed.

### Mapping 1:m relationships
To map 1:m, the primary key of the unique or "one" side of the relationship is referenced as a foreign key in the "many" side.
- Storing foreign keys to an arbitrary number of entities in any given entity
  can't be normalized, and is computationally hairy.
- Storing a singular foreign key across an arbitrary number of keys has some
  amount of duplication, but is able to be normalized and is computationally
stable.

### Mapping n:m relationships
Mapping these is so common there's a name for the technique. An associative
entity contains the primary keys from both sides of the relationship.
- These primary keys form a composite primary key for that associative entity.

### Mapping parallel relationships
Parallel relationships occur when there are two or more relationships between
two entity types. 
- In order to distinguish between the two relationshpis, we can give the foreign keys different names
- Each relationship is mapped according to best practices, so for a 1:m parallel, the "m" end will house the foreign keys.

### Mapping 1:m in unary relationships
One example is where an employee manages other employees in addition to
themselves. They are just another kind of employee, but they are also the
manager in the relationship.
Each entity has:
- Primary key of self, obviously
- A foreign key referencing the manager's primary key, but ideally named in a
  way to indicate the relationship.
- The manager's foreign key simply points to their own primary key

# SQL Server (MS and otherwise, as much agnostic as possible)

## Versions
- Use a stable & supported version of software.
	+ You don't want to have a problem with an unsupported version of the
	  SQL server or host server OS in production, because nobody can help
you.

## Hardware and software requirements
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15)
(Microsoft, though some of it is broadly applicable)
- NTFS or ReFS Filesystems recommended for SQL Server (Microsoft)
	+ The key part is that the filesystem be secure, stable and well supported.
	+ For that reason, FAT32, etc, is not recommended, because even though
	  it is supported, it is not secure.
- Drive can't be read-only, mapped, or compressed
- Installation will fail if launched through Remote Desktop Connection.
	+ Remote install must be done on a network share or local to the
	  physical or VM.
	+ SQL Server install media amy either be on a network share, mapped
	  drive, local drive, or as an ISO.
