On the topic of Security
========================
From week of 2018-11-20, when I was away

Database security works through users, groups, roles, and permissions.
In many ways, it is not unlike standard unix-y access controls. This is
necessary for a number of reasons, not the least of which is to protect
against theft and fruad, to protect secrecy, privacy, integrity, and
availability. My security class has phrased this as AIC: Availability,
Integrity, and Confidenditality.

Using encrypted and secure protocols to communicate information to users
will help prevent theft by wiretapping. Users and their permissions also
play into this.

General hardening techniques include the use of RAID (Redundant Array of
Independent Disks), to keep constant parallel backups. If configured
correctly, this can also increase the data throughput for reads and
writes. RAIDing and other backups, such as hot sites, also plays into
availability.

##DAC and MAC
Discretionary Access Control is a fairly simple privilege and rights
system, and in SQL is largely implemented through ``GRANT``-ing and
``REVOKE``-ing rights.

Mandatory Access Control lays on top of DAC, and is a more complete way
of preventing users from sharing information they have access to with
users who do not.

Physical security and other security levels are outside of the scope of
this document.

##MS SQL Server Access Controls
T-SQL provides two methods of access control and user authentication.
One is based on Active Directory/Windows authentication, such that users
log into the database system using their Windows credentials. Some
applications allow users to automatically log in to the DBMS as
themselves when logged into their machine. This is the default for
T-SQL.

The other method is "Mixed", which serves users based on both Windows
Auth and DBMS auth. Unless using MacOS or Linux with Windows Auth
accounts as served by LDAP or similar, Mixed mode is necessary for
non-Windows users.

###Syntax
A ``LOGIN`` is a DB object which can be ``CREATE``-ed. T-SQL offers a
specific way to handle adding a Windows account. As such, it takes
the form of:

```
CREATE LOGIN login_name FROM WINDOWS
	[WITH [DEFAULT_DATABASE = database]
		[, DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = language]]
```

The literal syntax for adding John Appleseed from the Accounting domain
would be:

```
CREATE LOGIN [Accounting\AppleseedJ] FROM WINDOWS;
```

####DBMS/Mixed authentication
Adding a user with DBMS authentication takes the form of:

```
create login login_name with password = 'pass'
	[MUST_CHANGE]
	[, DEFAULT_DATABASE]
	[, DEFAULT_LANGUAGE]
	[, CHECK_EXPIRATION = {ON|OFF}]
	[, CHECK_POLICY = {ON|OFF}]
```
