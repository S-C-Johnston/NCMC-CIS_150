# Relational algebra
...is: the formal description of how a relational database operates
- an interface to the data stored in the database itself
- the mathematics which underpin SQL operations

## Glossary
- Relation: a set of tuples
- Tuple: an arbitrary collection of attributes which describe an entity
- Attribute: a real world role played by a named domain
- Domain: a set of atomic values
- Set: a mathematical definition for a collection of objects having no
  duplicates.

## Ops for writing
- INSERT: provides a list of attributes for a new tuple. SQL equivalent
- DELETE: provides a condition on the attributes of a relation to determine which entities to remove. SQL equivalent.
- Modify: changes the values of one or more attributes in one or more entities
  of a relation, as identifiied by conditions. Equivalent to SQL UPDATE

## Ops for reading
Two groups of oprations:
1. Mathematical set theory: UNION, INTERSECTION, DIFFERENCE, and CARTESIAN PRODUCT.
2. Special database ops: Select (not the same SQL SELECT), Project, and JOIN

### Relational Select
Select is used to obtain a subset of the tuples of a relation according to a condition.

### Relational Project
Used to select a subset of attributes from a relation

### Set Ops -- semantics
Relations R & S:
- Union of R & S: logical OR 
- Intersection of R & S: Logical AND
- Difference of R & S: Logical XOR

### Cartesian Product
Sometimes called a Cross Product of Cross Join. It combines the tuples of one relation with all the tuples of the other relation. Exponentially difficult.

### JOIN op
JOIN is used to combine related tuples from two relations
- In its simplest form the JOIN operator is just the cross product of the two relations
- As the JOIN becomes more complex, tuples are removed within the cross product to make the result of the join more meaningful.
- JOIN allows you to evaluate a join condition between the attributes of the relations on which the join is undertaken.

#### Natural Join
Joins which have an equality condition are often described as an equi-join.
Such joins result in two attributes in the resulting relation having exactly
the same value. A "natural join" will remove the duplicate attributes.
