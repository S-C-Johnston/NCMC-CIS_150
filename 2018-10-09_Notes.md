#Normalization
The process of reducing data into a set of relations such that data is not lost
and that redundancy is not introduced.

- 1st Normal Form
- 2nd Normal Form
- 3rd Normal Form
- Boyce-Codd Normal Form

4th and 5th normal form are not covered in this session

Normal form is dependent on "lower" forms. 3rd normal form must also by
definition adhere to 1st and 2nd normal forms.

##Integrity constraints
Rules which restrict the values which may be present in the database.
- Entity integrity: Rows/tuples in a relation must be uniquely identified.
- Referential integrity: Foreign keys which point at other relations must be
  accurate, and what it references shouldn't disappear.

##Understanding data
Normalization is often dependent on the use case.

A functional dependency looks like A -> B, where B is a single attribute which can be found by looking at A. In doing so, A should be:
- Unique
- Related to the value it determines

In short, A points to B, as such, B is functionally dependent on A. The inverse
may not be true: B may be information which is not unique, and can't be
unambiguously linked back to A.

###Repeating groups
Notation of repeating groups places the repeated attributes in its own set of parenthesis, as such:
	Student(autoid, etc, (subject, grade))

**1NF requires that there be no repeating groups. That for any given row, an
attribute value is atomic.**

In order for values to be unambiguously determined, they need keys. If some
part of the repeating group for any given tuple is unique, then it may serve as
a candidate key.

Design intuited from example data is only as good as the examples themselves.
If they don't represent the breadth of what can happen, then the design will be
incomplete. For a small set with no collisions, candidate keys may look
appealing that would not work in a hypothetical infinitely large set.

###Flattened tables
A table with repeating groups can be normalized to 1NF by flattening the table.

Flattening results in the parent entity appearing once for each set in the
repeating groups. If Bobby Sue has 3 sets in its repeating group, then Bobby's
entity will apear 3 times, once for each set. Similarly Joe's will apear 4
times if he has 4 sets in his repeating group.

This allows for any given attribute of an entity to be unambiguously and simply
queried, without having to unpack stacked data. However, flattening does
introduce redundancy of all other information.

##First Normal Form
1NF deals with the shape of the records.

	A relation is in 1NF if and only if it contains no repeating attributes
	or groups of attributes. Each value must be atomic, or indivisible.

If a table has repeating groups, it is "unnormalized". Relational databases can't handle multiple values for any given attribute. 

Removing repating groups can be done through flattening the table and extending
the primary key, or decomposing the relationship into multiple tables.

##Candidate key
A candidate key is either a single attribute which uniquely identifies a
record, or a compound key composed of the fewest attributes needed to uniquely
identify the record.
