Short Answer
============

1. Database schemas are spoken of in two senses. In an abstract formal
   sense, a schema is the definition of the relationships and data
structures in a database. In the practical sense, a schema is often
treated by DBMSs and DBAs as a namespace or container for database
objects, such as tables, indices, etc. Users can be assigned permissions
to a schema, and by default unless otherwise specified at user creation,
they use the "dbo" schema.
