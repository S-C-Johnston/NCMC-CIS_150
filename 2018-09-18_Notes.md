ER Modelling:
 - A design tool
 - A graphical representation of the database system
 - Provides a high-level conceptual data model
 - supports the user's perception of data
 - is DBMS and hardware independent
 - has many variants
 - is composed of entites (records), attributes (fields), and relationships
   (foreign key)

Entity:
 - Any object in the system that we want to model and store information
   about
 - Individual objects are called entities
 - Groups of the same type are called entity types or sets
 - Represented by rectangles
 - Two kinds: strong and weak entities

Attribute
 - All the data relating to an entitie is held in is attributes
 - An attribute is a property of an entity
 - Each attribute can have any value in its domain, or constraints
 - Each entity within an entity type:
	* May have any number of attributes
	* Can have different attribute values than that in another entity
	* Have the same number of attributes
 - Can be:
	* simple or composite
	* Single or multi-valued
 - Attributes can be shown on ER models
 - They appear inside ovals and are attached to their entity

Keys
 - Allow unique ID individual instances of an entity type
 - Candidate key: an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely ID an
   instance
 - Selected key for reference is known as primary key
 - Name of primary key attribute is underlined

Relationships
 - Relationship type: meaningful association between entity types
 - Relationship: association of entities where the association includes one
   entity from each type
 - Relationship notation: either in a diamon, or setting on the line attaching
   two entities

Degree of relationship
 - Binary: Two entity types
 - Ternary: Three entity types
	* May want to change by replacing convoluted relationships with another
	  entity which houses those relationships.
 - N-ary: N entity types
 - Unary: or recursive, one entity has a relationship with itself

Cardinality
 - Relationships are rarely one to one
	* Manager usually manages more than one employee
 - One to one (1:1)
	* Straight connection
 - One to many (1:m)
	* Crow's foot on "many" end
 - Many to one (m:1)
 - Many to many (m:n)

Optionality
 - Mandatory: Must be related to an entity at the other end
 - Opionality can be different at each end of a relationship
	* A student must have a course, but a course can exist without any
	  students
 - Indicated with an "O" on the optional end


# Primary key

(From

A primary key should be:
 - Stable: it should never change after assignment
 - Single purpose: should have no purpose other than identification

Table consists of:
 - Key Columns: contain information that distinguishes a record from every
   other item represented in the table
	* unique key known as primary key
 - Descriptor columns: contain information about the thing to which the record
   pertains

Mark a primary key in an ER model with something that makes it distinct. An
asterisk or underline works.

Candidate key: A column or set of columns that can be used as a primary key for
the table. A candidate key with multiple columns would use all those columns
together as the primary key. If being used as a primary key, should similarly
be stable. A primary key cannot in any circumstances be null.

# Foreign key

(From

A foreign key is a column referencing a primary key of another table.
