Cloud
=====

## Pros: ##
- Physical and electronic security is outsourced
- Typically available all the time
- Scalability: paying only for what you need
- Expertise and support also available and on staff
- Backups and other components of service can be easily outsourced

## Cons: ##
- Expanding the security boundary
- Don't own the hardware
- Remotely hosted data is subject to network outages
- Time of response may vary, and may not be acceptable for some
  applications

NoSQL
=====

Use non-relational data-structures optimized for frequently changing
structure, but because it needs to relax some of the ACID properties, it
is not as ideal for change-sensitive content. Great for a site with lots
of extensible requirements and primarily read-only content, with
infrequent writing, but not so good for highly-transactional needs such
as banking.
