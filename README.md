# NCMC CIS 150 -- 2018-2019 Fall semester
## Intro to database administration

This is from the 2018-2019 fall semester. The git log will show many modifications as I was working on cleaning up and importing the files, but all this material is not fundamentally different. I have omitted the bundled files and pdfs and assignment documents, only uploading that which I worked on directly.

To which end, source viewable, but I reserve copyright.
