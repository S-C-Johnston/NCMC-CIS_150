##File management

###Hierarcy of data

Bits: Binary digits. 1s and 0s
Characters: Individual alphanumeric pieces of data.
Data Field: A consistent categorized box in which data is kept.
Record: A group of fields which are associated as one unit
File/Table: A group of records listed as a group.
Database: A collection of all tables/files of the organization.

###Procedures in data management

File/table creation
Record creation, editing, querying, deletion and reporting
Indexing

####Secondary Storage Devices Classification

By function:
 1. Sequential: used primarily for batch processing and backup
 2. Random access (DASD): used for online processing

Magnetic disks tend to support random access, but often require a file table to
do this.

Tapes and optical discs typically rely on sequential access and storage.
Tape Archive (.tar) filetype was built to support this kind of contiguous
concatenation and storage.

####Procedures for Sequential (batch) processing

 1. The Master file contains data from previous cycle. Data is stored
sequentially, sorted by the record key.
 2. Transactions are accumulated on a Transaction file in the random order they
arrive.
 3. Periodically, the Transactions file is sorted by the key and merged with
the Master file to create a new Master file.

Data redundancy is a bad thing. The same record should be accessed and edited
in one place.

###Database models

Hierarchical database structure resembles a tree, each node having a parent,
excepting the uppermost node. The structure resembles a very basic file
system in some senses. Each child or node can only have one direct parent,
however.

Network database structure is similar to a hierarchical model. Instead of
single-parent trees, the network model uses set theory. In it, child tables
can have more than one parent. This allows the network model to support many
relationships.

The relational model allows for organization and access according to the
relationships, plural, between records without the consideration of physical
orientation and relationship between tables.

##Three schema architecture

 1. Internal schema: Describes the physical storage structure of the database.
The internal schema uses a physical data model. It describes the complete
details of data storage.

 2. Conceptual schema: Describes the structure of the whole database, while
obscuring the exact details of physical storage. It focuses on entities, data
types, relationships, and constraints.

 3. External schema: Each individual external schema describes the part of the
database that the user wants to see and obscures the rest.

###Data independence

 - Physical data independence
	* The ability to modify the physical scheme without causing
	  applications to be rewritten.
	* Modifications at this level are usually to improve performance.
 - Logical data independence
	* The ability to modify the conceptual scheme without causing
	  application programs to be rewritten.
	* Usually done when logical structure of database is altered.
