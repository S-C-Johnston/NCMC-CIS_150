# Structured Query Language (SQL)
Declarative, rather than imperative language. The programmer dictates only what
the machine is meant to do (retrieve, edit, create data), and on what
conditions (matching value in some column, etc), but not how.

It's defined as an ANSI/ISO standard, but different dialects exist which extend
that standard in their own ways. T-SQL (Transact SQL) is one such language.

## Select statement basic syntax
1. SELECT
2. FROM
3. WHERE
4. ORDER BY
