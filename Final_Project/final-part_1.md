Fullsoft Incorporated recently suffered breach of data confidentiality,
damaging its competitive advantage. Proprietary information was
exfiltrated as a result of malware attack.

This document is an informal collection of thoughts to aid discussion in
an organization meeting, to help make accessible to potential laymen the
security team's expertise. Specifically, the incident itself is to be
analyzed, as well as the impact it may carry.

Circumstances
=============
Malware can spread through an number of vectors. Malware which is
capable of actually executing and exfiltrating data is likely to take
only a handful of forms.

To lay some groundwork terms:
1. Threat: Any action which can potentially harm the availability,
   integrity, or confidentiality of information. Need not be malicious,
merely harmful.

2. Internal threat: A threat from inside the organization. This can be
   as simple as a well-meaning user doing something foolish, or as
complex as a disgruntled employee acting maliciously.

   It is important that we educate users of their responsibility in
avoiding this, but for morale it is likely best we avoid admonishing
them to harshly or making them feel stupid. Users are easily made to
feel stupid just by asking for help from IT or seeing how quickly
computer professionals solve an issue they were struggling with for
potentially hours. My experience is that it is best to encourage them
and provide ample opportunity to overcome that feeling. Users who feel
inconvenienced or patronized are likely to attempt to circumvent
security measures, so a balance must be found.

3. Remote threat: A threat from outside the organization/network. Remote
   threats are likely to leverage whatever vulnerabilities they find,
including the goodwill and cooperativeness of individuals in the
organization.

Because we have limited time and resource, although we would ideally
want to shore up every possible vector, we'll list those most likely to
least likely.

1. Software intentionally but not maliciously installed by a user on the
   network. This is one of the most common threats, is an internal
threat caused by well-meaning but ignorant users.

 1. Far and away the most likely breed of malware is a trojan of some
    kind, or otherwise malicious software smuggled in on the back of
useful software. They initiate on a network primarily through social
engineering attacks, such as email-attachments. Trojans are often
deployed with the intention of using them as a backdoor which tries to
phone home to the attacker or which the attacker can use to log in to
the machine remotely.  

	- Not totally unlikely that a trojan may have been crafted
	  specifically for us by a competing organization or criminal.
Attacking by leaving infected Flash-Drives in a parking lot for the
curious employee to pick up and plug in is not unheard of.

 2. By distinction, a virus is usually less stealthy and usually more destructive in behavior, and it typically aims either to disrupt
operations or make itself known. A virus will usually spread through
infected files or programs, being attached to some host file, and upon
running will attempt to infect other host files. Although the need to
ride on the back of something innocent-looking may seem like trojan
behavior, the viral, self-replicating nature is what makes it a
virus, while trojans typically don't attempt this self-replicating
behavior.

2. A remote attacker may have found a vulnerable internet-facing server
   and through it, pivoted elsewhere. They could leave a rootkit behind,
allowing them return access. Without interacting with any member of
staff, they may have been performing reconnaissance for some time. If
our organization was the subject of corporate espionage, this is not an
unlikely move.

Similar Incidents
=================
Two similar occasions are available to dissect.

##Panic 

The software company [Panic](https://panic.com) suffered theft of their
source code.  According to their
[blog](https://panic.com/blog/stolen-source-code/) from one of the
developers, the thieves delivered their attack by disguising their
software as a video-codec processing program called Handbrake.

1. Handbrake is legitimate software, but for a period of three days it
   was vulnerable, and during that time the software was "nagging them
for some time to install an update".

2. When the program reported that an incremental update was not
   available, it prompted for a full download of the next version. The
developer, just wanting to get on with it, didn't stop to think about
why Handbrake needed elevated privileges to run, or about how sketchy
the authentication dialogue seemed at the time.

3. Git credentials were stolen and used to clone several repositories of
   their source code. Panic was lucky in that the attacker did not get
clones of every repository, largely because the attacker was guessing at
their repository names.

 - _There is no reason to believe that we are this lucky_.

4. They were contacted by the thief to the effect of a ransom. "Pay us
   or we'll release it into the wild" is an effective summary. There is
no reason to believe that once paid the thief will keep their promise.

 - These are digital assets which can be copied and redistributed
   easily, not a person or physical goods which must be returned.

They came to three conclusions about the likely impact, which will be
discussed later.

##Valve Software

Valve is a games company who suffered
[theft](https://games.slashdot.org/story/03/10/02/1547218/half-life-2-source-code-leaked)
of source code for [Half-Life
2](https://web.archive.org/web/20040828084259/http://www.halflife2.net:80/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=10692).
At the time of the theft, they had been forced to announce a delay of
the highly anticipated game. The remote threat was not someone
interested in monetary game, but a
[fan](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/)
who had a history of cracking game licenses. It was shared online by
someone with whom the thief had shared his discovery. In any case, the
process involved:

1. The attacker scanned their network, finding vulnerabilities which
   exposed the layout and topology of the internal network.

2. Mail accounts were accessed by the attacker, in particular the
   Managing Director's.  Valve came to know this by examining their
logs.

3. Malware had potentially infected the Managing Director's machine.

4. Source code was copied and exfiltrated. Apparently only the main
   trunk of the code was grabbed, which was not in itself enough to make
a playable executable.

5. Keyloggers were installed by exploiting a vulnerability in Outlook.
   The malware was a customized version of existing software, this fork
designed to infect Valve.

Potential Impact
================

From examining similar accounts, there are a handful of things which may
happen. This list is non-prioritized, since we can't say for sure what
kind of entity was the origin of this threat, or to which extent
information and source code was stolen. If we got lucky, then only a
portion of our code was cloned, but we can't assume this.

- **Cracked versions of our software are released**, in a word:
  pirating. It is probable this was already happening, to be quite
honest. If no other damage occurs, this would be a blessing.

- **Malware infected versions of our apps are released**. As the Panic
  developers noted, if this occurred because of a trojan of legitimate
software, there is a high risk it opens up our end-users to this same
kind of attack. We need to take steps to stem the flow and invalidate
any developer certificates they may have stolen. End-users need to be
made aware, and if we have any distribution points through
third-parties, like Apple's App Store, Google Play, or linux community
package managers, we must double down on working with them to prevent
unauthorized versions of our software from being released through those
means.

- **Knowledge of our program structure allows for further theft**,
  especially concerning if there is any user-data which can be accessed
by someone who merely knows how we retrieve it. This would likely be the
most damaging to our operations, our end-users, and our reputation. If
we can stop this from becoming a user-data breach, then we should do so
as quickly as possible. Possible steps include:

 + Rotating passwords, certificates, or anything else used to gain
    access to our data.

 + Migrating our data to different servers entirely.

 + Invalidate the old API for end-users to connect. This will put any
   users who do not regularly update their installations of our software
out of service until they do, but that's a small consequence compared to
user-data theft.

- **Competitors use this information to creep up on our competitive
  edge**. As Panic software notes, this clone that the attackers have
will rapidly go out of date as we continue to develop and improve our
software. A competitive edge is valuable, but if a competitor released
software with our fingerprints all over it, that would be quite damning.
This is also one of the less severe consequences we could face, in this
professional's opinion. If this is all that happens, our best bet is to
continue our development and release cycle, while dedicating some
resources to shoring up our leaks and preventing this from happening
again.

Countermeasures
===============
This list is presented in a very rough order of what is easy, and high
priority. It remains unnumbered because the priority, ease, and
efficiency is not set in stone.

- The first and easiest thing we can put in place immediately is to keep
  our antiviral software up to date and to actually use it frequently.
Scheduling anti-malware software to run on a daily basis during
off-hours would be wise. Allowing each person to run anti-malware scans
on their machine during their lunch break would help catch any threats
which come in during the morning hours, when many people check their
email.

- Rotating our current passwords and reviewing our password policy may
  create some productivity hiccups, but it is necessary. If we don't
have 2 factor authentication in place for members with higher
privileges, we should.

- A policy which can help prevent suffering from the hijacking of
  legitimate software is to establish an organization software
distribution point for our internal users. The IT staff can evaluate
software for any problems and deploy updates when they are determined
safe to use.

 + If this proves to be out of our ability, then if software is not
   deploying security updates specifically, it would be wise to wait a
week to see if any nastiness crops up. Most vulnerabilities are
discovered within a week of a software update which creates the
vulnerability, and the bleeding edge is sometimes a dangerous place to
be. Security updates are the only thing which should be rushed.

 + Additionally, it would be wise to practice policy that software
   installation go through the IT staff. Not all software is something
we as an organization need or want on our network. This may be
difficult, but thinking well enough ahead of time to make requests and
have those requests vetted should be within the capability of a software
development company.

- Practicing a least-privileges model of security is almost always a
  wise thing to do. The efficacy of this will depend greatly on our
making daily operations convenient to do without requiring elevated
privileges. In effect: make sure every user logs into the network and
into their own machines with only as many privileges as they need. BYOD
can make this difficult to implement successfully, but can be done.

- Speaking of Bring Your Own Device: Full-disk encryption on machines
  which may travel outside our network is a good idea. If someone can
get physical access to a box, the only way to keep them from owning it
is to have strong protections on the entirety of its contents, without
merely relying on the security provided when the OS is loaded.

- Machines storing sensitive information should be kept with both strong
  physical and digital security measures. Full-disk encryption, as
mentioned, can do wonders, and we use it under the assumption that
things will go wrong. For physical security, literally bolting things
down may or may not be overkill. Such measures as chipped security
cards, or other things in the categories of "things your have" or "things
you are" would probably not go amiss. These generally do not impact
productivity overly much.
