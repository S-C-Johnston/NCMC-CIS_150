#Joins
Basic syntax
```TSQL
SELECT table.column[,...n]
FROM tableA
[INNER|LEFT|RIGHT|FULL] JOIN tableB
ON tableA.column = tableB.column
[,...n];
```

The JOIN keyword is an infix operator, such that the first parameter is the
"left" table, and the second parameter is the "right" parameter.

##Kinds of JOINs
- [INNER] JOIN: Returns records which have matching values in both tables.
  Similar to a logical intersection.
- LEFT [OUTER] JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, or the first
  parameter, but only the records from the right table which have matching
  values.
- RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, or the second
  parameter, but only the records from the left table which have matching
  values.
- FULL [OUTER] JOIN: Return all records when there is a match in either table.
