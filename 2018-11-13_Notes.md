Aggregate functions
===================
Functions provided by the RDMBS which take the form of ``functionname()``

``COUNT()`` returns the number of rows that match a condition.

``AVG()`` returns the mean average of the values from the selected numeric column.

``SUM()`` returns the sum of the selected numeric column

```SQL
SELECT FUNCTION_NAME(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Any query which uses an aggregate function also needs a GROUP BY clause on all non-aggregate attributes selected to be legal. So, for:
```SQL
SELECT field_a, field_b, COUNT(field_c)
FROM table_a
GROUP BY field_a, field_b
```
